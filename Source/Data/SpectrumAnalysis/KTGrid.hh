 @brief Contains KTGrid
 @details This class defines a grid class with X,Y and summed voltages for the position. that can then be used for searching/optimizing the position of the electron. Currently only done in cartesian coordinate systems. This can later be used to extended to polar as well if needed. For later, this can actually be just a struct with each struct object having positions and voltages and the classes that uses objects of this class can just make an array of these objects.
