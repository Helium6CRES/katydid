Katydid is a data analysis package for Project 8.
It is written in C++ and uses ROOT classes extensively.

Requirements:
  ROOT (tested with 5.26.00), including the FFTW package (root.cern.ch)
  FFTW3 (required for ROOT's FFTW package) (www.fftw.org)
  Mini-XML (www.minixml.org)

Directory contents:
  bin - Executable binaries will be placed here
  lib - Libraries will be placed here
  Scripts - A collection of useful (or not) shell and ROOT scripts
  Source
    Egg - Header and source files for all of the classes (so far)
    Main - Source code for executables
  tmp - Object files will be placed here during the build
  
Installation:
  1. cd into the top-level directory (where this README file is located)
  2. Type 'make' and press enter
  
Usage notes:
  1. You will need to load the library (lib/libEgg.so) into ROOT, if using this code in an interactive ROOT session.
  2. You'll need to add Source/Egg to the include path in the ROOT session.
  3. The classes are in the namespace Katydid.
  4. Scripts/PlotEvent.C will give you an idea of how the package should be used (Note: the last time I actually tried using the script it gave me a seg fault that I haven't diagnosed yet; the code itself works, though, as I've tested in other contexts)
  
Other notes:
  1. KTEgg and KTEvent are C++ versions of Lisa McBride's monarch library.
  2. The executable ExtractEvents is based on Lisa's code for printing power spectra to text files, though it doesn't perform the FFT or write any files.  It's there for testing purposes only.
