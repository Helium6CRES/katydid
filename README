Katydid is a data analysis package for Project 8.
It is written in C++ and uses ROOT classes extensively.

Requirements:
  ROOT (tested with 5.26.00), including the FFTW package (root.cern.ch)
  Mini-XML (www.minixml.org)
  
  If building from source:
  CMake (tested with 2.8)

Directory contents:
  Scripts - A collection of useful (or not) shell and ROOT scripts
  Source
    Egg - Classes involved in getting an event out of a data file.
    FFT - Classes involved in making FFTs from events
    Main - Source code for executables
  
Installation:
  1. cd into the top-level directory (where this README file is located)
  2. Run 'cmake .'
  3. Run 'make
  4. Run 'make install'
  
  At step 2 you can alternatively use ccmake or cmake-gui to have more control over the configuration.
  
Documentation:
  1. This README file contains some useful information.
  2. Code reference material can be found in Documenation/html/index.html
  
Usage notes:
  0. The default build location is a subdirectory called cbuild.
  1. The libraries will be installed in the lib directory.
  2. The binaries will be installed in the bin directory.
  3. You will need to load the libraries into ROOT, if using this code in an interactive ROOT session.
  4. You may need to add cbuild/include to the include path in the ROOT session.
  5. The classes are in the namespace Katydid.
  6. Scripts/PlotPowerSpectrum.C will give you an idea of how the package should be used.
  
Other notes:
  1. KTEgg and KTEvent are C++ ports of Lisa McBride's monarch library.
  2. The executable ExtractEvents is based on Lisa's code for printing power spectra to text files, though it doesn't perform the FFT or write any files.  It's there for testing purposes only.
