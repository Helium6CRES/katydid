JSON Syntax for Configuration Files
===================================

Basic Syntax
------------

All of the basic rules of JSON apply.  We recommend `json.org <http://www.json.org>`_ as a basic reference.

Comments
--------

Since standard JSON doesn't include explicit rules for comments, we've made the following syntax extensions for 
Katydid configuration files:

* To make an object, array, or value that will be ignored, simply use "comment" as the name or the beginning of the name:

::

    "comment":
    {
        "thing1": 5,
        "thing2": 7
    },
    "comment": "this will also be ignored",
    "comment - so will this": 42,
    "comment - an ignored array":
    [
        100,
        1000,
        10000
    ]

* You can also comment out objects, arrays, 
  or values by preceding their name with a # sign:

::

    "use-this":
    {
        "size": 5
    },
    "#not-this":
    {
        "size": 10
    }

* You can comment out values in an array by adding an value "###" (three # signs); all values following that in the array will be ignored.
  One application of this is to allow you to comment out individual values in an existing array, by wrapping that value in another 
  set of array brackets, and preceding it with "###":

::

    "array-to-be-ignored":
    [
        "###",
        "4980",
        "83",
        "903125"
    ],
    "array-to-be-used-except-for-one-value":
    [
        "row",
        "row",
        "row",
        "your",
        ["###", "car"],
        "boat"
    ]

  Note that this creates an exception to the general allowance of empty arrays.  If the entire contents of the array are commented 
  out with "###" (as in the above example's array-to-be-ignored), the array itself will be ignored.
