Tips on Installing the Dependencies
-----------------------------------

MacOS: [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a convenient package manager. Before using it for the installation, make sure that the version available on brew is compatible with what is listed in the dependency list above. [CMake](http://brewformulas.org/Cmake), [Boost](http://brewformulas.org/Boost), [Hdf5](http://brewformulas.org/Hdf5), [Protobuf](http://brewformulas.org/Protobuf), and [Root](http://brewformulas.org/root) are all available through brew via the instructions in these links.




Installation
-------------

The following steps will build Katydid from scratch.  Starting with a terminal window . . .

1. Clone the repository and make a build directory as recommended above. You will also have to initialize the submodules.
   ::

     $ git clone "https://github.com/project8/Katydid"
     $ cd Katydid
     $ git submodule update --init --recursive
     $ mkdir build

2. To configure the installation you can use cmake, ccmake, or cmake-gui.

   For a first configuration, using either ccmake or cmake-gui is highly recommended.  The following instructions are for ccmake, but the steps with cmake-gui would be approximately the same.
   ::

     $ cd build
     $ ccmake ..


   You will be prompted to press [c] to configure, and the window will fill up with several options. 

   You should set the CMake variable `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` to either `RELEASE`, `STANDARD`, or `DEBUG` (default), in order
   of how much text output you would like (from least to most) and how much compiler optimization
   should be performed (from most to least). You may wish to to activate C++14 support with USE_CPP14=ON if your ROOT version was built with C++14 support.

   Variables that start with `Katydid_` will control which parts of Katydid are built.

   If using Monarch, if you want to read egg3 files, ensure that `Monarch_BUILD_MONARCH3` is set.
   If you want to read egg2 files, ensure that `Monarch_BUILD_MONARCH2` is set.

   The install prefix is specified by the CMake variable `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`.
   The library, binaries, and header files will be installed in the
   lib, bin, and include subdirectories. The default install prefix is the
   build directory.

   After you've finished, if you've changed anything press [c] again to configure.  Then [g] to generate and exit.

3. Build and install.
   ::

     $ make install


   Or if you want to take advantage of parallel building to get things done faster:
   ::

     $ make -j install


  If the compiler runs into errors during the build, first check that you've updated the submodules and that you have all of the required dependencies installed (many are called "optional" on this page, but if you want to build without them you must also specify this in the cmake window). If you made a change to the dependencies or submodules, you may have to wipe the build directory and start again from step 1; simply writing `make install` again will not always work.
